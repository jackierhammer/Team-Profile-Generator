# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
    
This application creates a webpage that displays informations about members of a team based on input given by the user. The user inputs the number of interns and engineers on the team and then answers a series of questions about the team manager, interns, and engineers. This information is then used to generate the webpage and organizes it into tiles for each employee.
